# JSON-viewer
I built this JSON viewer specially designed for HS developers.
It have features like: 
- minizing nodes (arrays or lists).
- Generate and auto copy snippet of the clicked element key or value. Jinja/HubL READY.
- visual tweakings to see it confortably.
- If you copy the whole text,  it will be exactly the response without any text/icon injected on the pure text (all managed with pure CSS/JS).

So nice, isn't it?
